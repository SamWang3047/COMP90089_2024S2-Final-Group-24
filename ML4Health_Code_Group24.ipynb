The plan is to use lab tests/measurements taken from several hours to half an hour before these periods (this window can be adjusted later for optimal performance) as features for prediction.\n","\n","## Key Measurements\n","The key measurements include:\n","- **Diastolic blood pressure** (220051)\n","- **Systolic blood pressure** (220050)\n","- **Heart rate** (220045)\n","- **SpO2** (220277)\n","- **MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure)** (220052)\n","- **Respiratory rate** (220210)\n","\n","Additionally, some general features like **age**, **gender**, etc., will be included to form the dataset for training and prediction.\n","\n","## Data Source and Processing\n","My data primarily comes from executing **SQL queries on Google BigQuery**. After that, the corresponding query results are downloaded as **CSV files**, which are then read into my code for use. If needed, we can modify the workflow to directly access the database and execute SQL queries in **Google Colab** to streamline the process later.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"bc163611","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730630526891,"user_tz":-660,"elapsed":315,"user":{"displayName":"Zhipeng
